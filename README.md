 Just a website written in Vue
# Introduction
This is my hobby project written in Vue, it's just my portfolio and nothing else.\
üåè VISIT: https://fowardslash.vercel.app
# How to use?
All firebase API stuffs are redacted out just for my wallet not to go up in flames.\
Re-add your firebase stuff before running the project.\
First, clone the repo, then open the terminal and type:
```
cd fowardslashVue
```
After you are in the folder, type:
```
npm install
```
And you are done!\
To run the website locally, type:
```
npm run dev
```
